# Weather-App
Weather app built using Mvvm architecture, dagger-hilt and coroutines

# Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to take the coding assignment.

Project is build up by using the following
* I am using dagger-hilt for dependecy injection
* coroutines and retrofit for networking calls
* navigation component for navigating fragment navigation
* live data for updating the view.
* I have used weatherbit api for fetching the forecast data
